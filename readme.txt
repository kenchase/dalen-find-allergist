== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is distance-based search? =

Distance-based search allows users to find physicians within a specific radius (in kilometers) of any Canadian postal code. For example, you can search for all allergists within 50km of postal code M5V 3M6 (Toronto downtown).

= Which Canadian postal codes are supported? =

All valid Canadian postal codes are supported. The plugin automatically geocodes postal codes using Google's Geocoding API to determine precise coordinates for distance calculations.

= Can physicians have multiple practice locations? =

Yes! The plugin supports physicians with multiple practice locations. Each location can have its own address, phone number, and coordinates. Distance searches will find physicians if ANY of their locations are within the specified radius.

= What specialties can be filtered? =

Currently, the plugin supports filtering for Oral Immunotherapy (OIT) specialists. Additional specialty filters can be added by extending the ACF field structure.

= Is the plugin mobile-friendly? =

Yes, the plugin is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices. The search interface adapts to different screen sizes for optimal user experience.

= Can I customize the search form? =

Yes, the plugin provides hooks and filters for customization. Developers can modify the search form appearance, add custom fields, or integrate with existing themes.

= Does this work with any theme? =

The plugin is designed to work with any properly coded WordPress theme. It uses shortcodes for display, making it compatible with most page builders and theme structures.

= Is there an API for developers? =

Yes! The plugin provides a REST API endpoint at `/wp-json/my/v1/physicians/search` with comprehensive search parameters. See the documentation for detailed API usage examples.
