# Fix: JavaScript Duplicate Declaration Error

**Date:** 2025-10-08  
**Issue:** `Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier '$' has already been declared`

## Problem

The `find-allergist.js` file was generating a JavaScript error in the console:

```
find-allergist.js?ver=1759949872:1 Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier '$' has already been declared
```

### Root Cause

The JavaScript file was **not wrapped in an IIFE** (Immediately Invoked Function Expression), which meant:

1. All variables were declared in the global scope
2. When the script was processed by the build system or loaded multiple times, variable declarations could conflict
3. Even though WordPress's `wp_enqueue_script()` should prevent duplicate loading, the lack of scope isolation made the code vulnerable to conflicts

## Solution

### 1. Wrapped JavaScript in IIFE

Modified `/assets/js/find-allergist.js`:

**Added at the beginning (after file header comments):**
```javascript
// Wrap entire script in IIFE to prevent variable conflicts
(function() {
'use strict';
```

**Added at the end:**
```javascript
})(); // End IIFE
```

This wrapping:
- ✅ Creates a private scope for all variables
- ✅ Prevents global namespace pollution
- ✅ Eliminates conflicts with other scripts
- ✅ Follows JavaScript best practices for WordPress plugins

### 2. Added Clarifying Comments

Updated both shortcode classes with clearer comments:
- `/includes/shortcodes/class-shortcode-faa-results.php`
- `/includes/shortcodes/class-shortcode-faa-search-form.php`

Added note that `wp_enqueue_script()` automatically prevents duplicates, which is the WordPress standard behavior.

## Testing

After the fix:

1. ✅ Built successfully with `npm run build`
2. ✅ Created production zip with `npm run zip`
3. ✅ No JavaScript syntax errors
4. ✅ File size: 20.11 kB (minified), 5.92 kB (gzipped)

## Files Modified

- `/assets/js/find-allergist.js` - Wrapped in IIFE
- `/includes/shortcodes/class-shortcode-faa-results.php` - Added clarifying comment
- `/includes/shortcodes/class-shortcode-faa-search-form.php` - Added clarifying comment

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy** the updated `dist/dalen-find-allergist.zip` to your WordPress site
2. **Clear browser cache** and WordPress caches
3. **Test** the search form and results on the front end
4. **Verify** no console errors appear

## Prevention

All WordPress plugin JavaScript files should be wrapped in IIFEs to:
- Prevent variable conflicts
- Maintain clean global namespace
- Avoid issues with script concatenation/minification
- Follow WordPress JavaScript coding standards

## Build Commands

```bash
# Development build
npm run build

# Create production zip
npm run zip
```

The production-ready file is at: `dist/dalen-find-allergist.zip`
