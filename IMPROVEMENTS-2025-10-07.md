# Code Quality Improvements - October 7, 2025

## Overview

Comprehensive improvements to `assets/js/find-allergist.js` and `assets/css/find-allergist.css` focusing on maintainability, accessibility, and code quality without introducing regressions.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Configuration Management (HIGH PRIORITY)

**What Changed:**

- Created centralized `FAA_CONFIG` object containing all magic numbers and strings
- Configuration includes: API settings, pagination, validation, map settings, UI timings, and error messages

- Maintained backward compatibility with original constant names

**Benefits:**

- Single source of truth for all configuration values
- Easy to modify settings without searching through code
- Better documentation of what each value controls

- Added note about `institutation_name` field name typo in ACF

**Benefits:**

- Easier for developers to understand code purpose

**What Changed:**

- Added ARIA live region for screen reader announcements
- Created `createAriaLiveRegion()` and `announceToScreenReader()` functions

---

### 8. ✅ CSS Browser Compatibility Fix

**What Changed:**

## Testing Checklist

### Critical Functionality (Must Test)

- [ ] Search by name
- [ ] Search by city
- [ ] Search by province
- [ ] Search by postal code
- [ ] Search with distance range
- [ ] Search with practice population filter
- [ ] Combined search criteria

### Postal Code Validation

- [ ] Enter invalid postal code - should show error
- [ ] Enter valid postal code - error should clear
- [ ] Range field should be disabled without valid postal code
- [ ] Range field should enable with valid postal code
- [ ] Formatting should add space after 3rd character

### Results Display

- [ ] Results show correctly after search
- [ ] Map displays with markers
- [ ] Click on marker shows info window
- [ ] "More Info" buttons expand/collapse organization details
- [ ] All organization information displays correctly

### Pagination

- [ ] Pagination shows for >20 results
- [ ] Click next page - should load next page
- [ ] Click previous page - should load previous page
- [ ] Click specific page number - should load that page
- [ ] Page numbers show correctly with ellipsis for many pages
- [ ] Scrolling to results works correctly

### User Interface

- [ ] Loading overlay shows during search
- [ ] Loading overlay hides after search completes
- [ ] Error messages display correctly for failed searches
- [ ] "Back to Search" link returns to form
- [ ] "Clear" button resets form
- [ ] Search form hides when results show
- [ ] Search form shows when using "Back to Search"

### Accessibility (if possible to test)

- [ ] Screen reader announces search results
- [ ] Screen reader announces page changes
- [ ] Focus moves to results after search
- [ ] All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- [ ] Tab order is logical

### Error Scenarios

- [ ] Network error - should show friendly message
- [ ] Empty results - should show "No results found"
- [ ] Invalid API response - should handle gracefully

---

## Regression Prevention

### What Was Preserved

1. **All original functionality** - no features were removed
2. **Backward compatibility** - original constants maintained
3. **CSS class names** - no existing classes changed
4. **API endpoints** - no changes to API calls
5. **Form behavior** - validation logic unchanged
6. **State management** - AppState structure preserved (except validationTimeout)

### Low-Risk Changes

- Configuration consolidation - values are the same, just organized
- JSDoc additions - comments don't affect runtime
- Dead code removal - was already commented out
- CSS extraction - visual appearance unchanged
- Error messages - only improved, not removed

### Testing Priority

**High Priority:**

1. Search functionality with all combinations
2. Postal code validation
3. Pagination
4. Map display and interaction

**Medium Priority:** 5. Loading states 6. Error handling 7. Form clearing 8. Back to search

**Low Priority:** 9. Accessibility features (progressive enhancement) 10. Console error logging

---

## Future Improvements (Not Implemented)

These were recommended but not implemented to minimize regression risk:

1. **Module Structure** - Split into multiple files (requires build process changes)
2. **State Manager Pattern** - Observer pattern for state (significant refactor)
3. **Template Literals** - Replace string concatenation (extensive changes)
4. **Performance Optimizations** - DocumentFragment, lazy loading (requires testing infrastructure)
5. **Code Duplication Reduction** - Extract more helper functions (time permitting)

These can be implemented incrementally in future iterations with dedicated testing cycles.

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered:

1. **Git Revert** - All changes are in single commits
2. **Config Rollback** - Can comment out FAA_CONFIG and restore original constants
3. **CSS Rollback** - Can restore inline styles temporarily
4. **Feature Flags** - Can wrap new features (accessibility, error handling) in conditional checks

---

## Notes

- **ACF Field Name**: The field `institutation_name` has a typo but is the actual field name. Do not change without updating ACF field definitions first.
- **Divi Theme Dependency**: `.et_pb_section` selector is Divi-specific but now configurable
- **Google Maps**: Map initialization remains unchanged for stability
- **Client-Side Pagination**: Preserved existing behavior - API call only on new searches

---

## Maintenance Guide

### To Change Configuration Values

Edit `FAA_CONFIG` object at top of `find-allergist.js`

### To Modify Loading Overlay

Edit CSS classes in `find-allergist.css` (lines 590-628)

### To Add New Error Types

1. Add to `FAA_ERROR_TYPES`
2. Add message to `FAA_CONFIG.messages`
3. Use `handleError()` function

### To Modify Accessibility Announcements

Edit calls to `announceToScreenReader()` function
